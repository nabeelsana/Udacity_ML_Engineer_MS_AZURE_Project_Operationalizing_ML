## Project Title: Operationalizing Machine Leaning Pipeline

As part of Udacity Machine Learning with Microsoft Azure Nano Degree program, we have to submit two projects to demonstrate operationalizing of Machine Learning pipeline. 

We have performed two experiments: 

i) Creating and operationalizing a pipeline using AutoML and Studio interface

ii) Creating and operationalizing a pipeline using Python SDK interface.
